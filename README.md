# Mars Rover built in Python!

I built this python script with Python3. I only had one file(mars_rover.py) as I didn't feel the need to have another class. There is another file in this repo
`directions.py` as I had the idea of using Enums to scope out the directions. I however, proceeded with just checking the inputs with strings.

## Future improvements:
Due to the very tight deadline of this challenge, not having a very free weekend, and not having been programming Python in years, there are definitely 
some improvements I could have done for this project.
- Unit testing
- Error handling with inputs
- Other best practices

## Instructions:
- clone repo
- run `python3 mars_rover.py`
- Enter input for Plateau
- Enter input for first rover position
- Enter input for first rover instructions
- Enter input for second rover position
- Enter input for sercond rover instructions

Provided data 
Plateau: 5 5  
First rover position: 1 2 N  
First rover instructions: LMLMLMLMM  
Second rover position: 3 3 E  
Second rover position: MMRMMRMRRM  

returns:
1 3 N  
5 1 E
